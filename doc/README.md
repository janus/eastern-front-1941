- [Playing](playing.md): annotated APX user guide explaining how to play the game

- [How it works](howitworks.md): annotated APX implementation notes and reflections on the development process


- `refdata/` - binary images for the APX and cartridge versions of the game, disassembled source and extracted data blobs
- `refdoc/` - various collected documents including a copy of the original annotated source code in `EFT*.ASM`
    with Chris Crawford's (searchable) [source notes][ccrtfnotes] and a more extensive [scanned PDF][ccpdfnotes]
    which includes additional diagrams and source dumps.
    I also extracted and reordered a subset of pages about the [AI][ccainotes].
    The original user manuals for both the [APX][apxmanual] and [cartridge][cartmanual] versions
    are worth a look, along with the boxed [map poster][mapposter] and an opening [APX screenshot][apxscreen]
    showing the initial score of 12.
